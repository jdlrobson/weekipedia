# Weekipedia [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jdlrobson/weekipedia.svg?branch=master&r=1)](https://travis-ci.org/jdlrobson/weekipedia)

Weekipedia is the Wikipedia mobile site reimagined in React.js. It is a 10% project and not officially supported by the Wikimedia Foundation.

The goals of this project include but are not limited to:

## End user goals
* Explore the concept of a webapp as an alternative to native apps
* Explore new ways to engage users to make Wikipedia a content destination (e.g. not somewhere people go from search engines)

## Engineering goals:
* Explore how complete our APIs are
* Improve mobile content service APIs for apps
* Provide an easy way for designers and engineers at the WMF to communicate with one another with a common language around components and explore redesigns
* Provide a consumer for code that currently lives inside MediaWiki to provide motivation to publish npm modules for useful functionality and for Wikimedia projects to become better open source citizens
* Explore how push notifications, service workers can fit into the MediaWiki ecosystem.
* Fun!

## Parity with MobileFrontend [![Parity status](https://travis-ci.org/jdlrobson/wikipedia-mobile-browser-tests.svg?branch=master&r=1)](https://travis-ci.org/jdlrobson/wikipedia-mobile-browser-tests)


Weekipedia is capable of everything that MobileFrontend does. All [anonymous MobileFrontend browser tests](https://github.com/jdlrobson/wikipedia-mobile-browser-tests) are run against Weekipedia.

Information on how to run browser tests is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jdlrobson/9e97205d232a70967f97675b8f2209a5). Where there is not parity please raise a Github issue.

	export DEV_DUMMY_USER=0
	# And you can test against the Wikimedia beta cluster
	export HOST_SUFFIX=.beta.wmflabs.org

##Running in production

	# Any known Wikimedia site runs on the .org domain. No support for other mediawiki instances at time of writing.

### Server side rendering
Do you want server side rendering?

	export SERVER_SIDE_RENDERING=1

### Other project support
Do you want to handle all Wikimedia projects or just the value you defined in PROJECT ?

	export SITE_ALLOW_FOREIGN_PROJECTS=1
	export SITE_ALLOWED_PROJECTS='wikivoyage|wikipedia'

### Site customisations

Sections:

	#To expand articles by default
	export SITE_EXPAND_ARTICLE=1
	# To expand sections by default only on tablet. If true overrides SITE_EXPAND_ARTICLE.
	export SITE_EXPAND_SECTIONS_TABLET_=1

	export GCM_SENDER_ID=
	export GCM_API_KEY=
	export TREND_ENABLED=1
	export TREND_EDITS_PER_MIN=0

### Offline support

First you'll need to chose an offline strategy.

	export OFFLINE_STRATEGY=all # all pages when visited will be cached locally
	export OFFLINE_STRATEGY=shell # only shell will be cached


You'll need to set an offline version. Please bump this whenever you want to trigger updates to your users.
It's recommended you use the commit id if working with git.

	OFFLINE_VERSION=$(git log | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}')
	export OFFLINE_VERSION=$OFFLINE_VERSION
	npm run compile
